HIV STATUS: 
0: Negative
1: Prevalent 

```{r}
all %>% ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(aes(factor(hivstat), age))+
  labs(x = "HIV Status", y = "Age")
```
We notice that there is no significant different in the ages of those with HIV infection compared to those without HIV

```{r}

all %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(hivstat), y = household_income)) +
  geom_boxplot()+
  labs(x = "HIV Status", y = "Household income")

```
There seems to be a little bit of a higher household income among those with HIV than those without HIV

```{r}

aids_proportion <- with(all, table(aids, hivstat)) %>% prop.table(margin = 2)
aids_proportion
```
Among those with HIV (hivstat = 1), only 29% have developed AIDS. This shows that HIV does not always lead to AIDS (contrarily to popular belief)

```{r}
partners_prop <- with(all, table(sex_partners, hivstat)) %>% prop.table(margin = 2)
partners_prop
```
The sex partner categories are as follows : 
1: 0 or no sex partners
2: 1 to 4 partners
3: 5 to 10 partners
4: 11 to 100 partners
5: more than 100 partners
-8 : don't know

We notice that for women with or without HIV status in this cohort, the number of sexual partners does not seem to change considerably.


```{r}
maritalstatus_prop <- with(all, table(marital_status, hivstat)) %>% prop.table(margin = 2)
maritalstatus_prop

```
The marital status categories are as follows: 
1: legally/common-law married
2: not married but living with partner
3: widowed 
4: divorced/annulled
5: separated
6: never married
7: other

We notice that among those with HIV, the biggest proportion has never been married. 
Also, there seems to be a significant bigger percentage of people who are widowed or divorced among the women with HIV than those without (will also see this in the summary of the logistic model below)
```{r}
glm_income <- glm(hivstat ~ I(household_income), data = all, family = binomial)
summary(glm_income)
```
At an alpha = 0.05 significance level, there seems to be a significant relationship between hiv status and household income. 

```{r}
glm_marital <- glm (hivstat ~ as.factor(marital_status) , data = all, family = binomial)
summary(glm_marital)
```
The odds of having HIV is significantly greater for women who are widowed or divorced than for women who are legally married.

```{r}
death_glm <- glm(death ~ ever_highcholesterol , family = binomial)
summary(death_glm)

```
Women who were ever told they had high cholesterol were more likely to die at the end of the study, compared with women who did not have high cholesterol. 


```{r}
glm_drug <- glm(hivstat ~ ever_drug_treatment, family = binomial)
summary(glm_drug)
```
At an alpha = 0.05 significance level, there seems to be a significant relationship between hiv status and receiving drug treatment. 



```{r}
death_logit = glm(death~ age, data = all , family = "binomial")
summary(death_logit)
exp(0.05201*10)
```
For every 10 year increase in age, the model predicts the odds of death to increase by a factor of 1.68
```{r}
hist1 = hist(all$age[all$death==1], plot = F, freq = F)
hist2 = hist(all$age[all$death==0], plot = F, freq = F)
plot( hist1, col=rgb(1,0,0,1/3), xlim=c(15,70), ylim = c(0,250), xlab = "age", main = "")  # first histogram
plot( hist2, col=rgb(0,0,1,1/4), xlim=c(15,70), add=T)  # second
lines(10:80,dnorm((10:80),mean = mean(all$age[all$death==1]), sd = sd(all$age[all$death==1]))*length(all$age[all$death==1])*5, col = rgb(1,0,0,2/3))
lines(10:80,dnorm((10:80),mean = mean(all$age[all$death==0]), sd = sd(all$age[all$death==0]))*length(all$age[all$death==0])*5, col = rgb(0,0,1,2/3))
```
As we can see in the plot of the histogram of women who died (red) and the histogram of the women who did not die (blue), the women who died were on average older than the women who did not die.

MODEL BUILDING: predicting HIV

We want to build a model predicting the incidence of HIV and using the following potential predictors:\


* 

"CASEID", "hivstat", "speak_spanish", "age", "ethnicity", "educ_level", "mother_educ", "drug", "sex_partners","first_pos_test", "birth_country", "marital_status", "living_with", "household_income", "family_cancer", "family_hbp", "family_cholesterol", "family_diabetes", "family_kidney" ," first_menstruation", "ever_mi", "ever_chf", "ever_stroke", "ever_highcholesterol", "ever_lung_clot", "ever_liverprob", "ever_hrt", "aids", "cancer", "tb", "death", "ever_marijuana", "ever_drug_treatment", "shared_needles", "ever_in_drug_detox", "ever_out_drug_detox", "ever_halfway_house", "ever_jail", "ever_sex_with_hiv_male", "ever_sex_with_gay_male", "condom_use", "ever_anal_sex", "ever_sex_toys", "sexual_orientation"

```{r}
my_data <- matrix(c(hivstat, age, ethnicity, educ_level, marital_status, living_with, household_income, ever_marijuana, ever_drug_treatment, shared_needles, ever_in_drug_detox, ever_out_drug_detox, ever_halfway_house, ever_jail, ever_sex_with_hiv_male, ever_sex_with_gay_male, condom_use, ever_anal_sex, ever_sex_toys, sexual_orientation), ncol = 20)
cor(my_data, method = "pearson")

```
Based on the correlation matrix, there is a very high correlation between the following variables: ever_drug_treatment, ever_in_drug_detox, ever_out_drug_detox, ever_halfway_house, ever_jail. \
So, we will only include one of these variables in our analysis instead of including them all. 

Based on our research, we are interested in assessing the effects of ever being in jail with the incidence HIV. So, we are going to keep ever_jail in our analysis. 

Going to attempt a forward selection process involving the following covariates : 

age, ethnicity, educ_level, marital_status, living_with, household_income, ever_marijuana, shared_needles, ever_jail, ever_sex_with_hiv_male, ever_sex_with_gay_male, condom_use, ever_anal_sex, ever_sex_toys, sexual_orientation, family_cancer, ever_mi, ever_chf, ever_highcholesterol, ever_liverprob

```{r}
glm1 <- glm(hivstat ~ 1, family = binomial)
forwardModel <- step(glm1, direction = "forward", 
                     scope = (~ age + as.factor(ethnicity) + as.factor(educ_level) + as.factor(marital_status) + living_with + household_income + as.factor(ever_marijuana) + as.factor(shared_needles) + as.factor(ever_jail) + as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male) + as.factor(ever_sex_with_gay_male) + as.factor(condom_use) + as.factor(ever_anal_sex) + as.factor(ever_sex_toys) + as.factor(sexual_orientation) + as.factor(family_cancer) + as.factor(ever_mi) + as.factor(ever_chf) + as.factor(ever_highcholesterol) + as.factor(ever_liverprob)))

```
So our first model option is : 
```{r}

mod.hiv1 <- glm(hivstat ~ as.factor(ever_marijuana) + as.factor(ever_liverprob) + living_with + as.factor(family_cancer) + age + as.factor(ever_chf) + as.factor(ever_anal_sex) + as.factor(ever_jail) + as.factor(shared_needles) + as.factor(educ_level) + as.factor(ever_sex_with_gay_male) + as.factor(marital_status) + as.factor(sexual_orientation) + as.factor(ethnicity), family = binomial)

```

Backward model : 

```{r}
glm2 <- glm(hivstat ~ as.factor(ethnicity) + as.factor(educ_level) + as.factor(marital_status) + living_with + household_income + as.factor(ever_marijuana) + as.factor(shared_needles) + as.factor(ever_jail) + as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male) + as.factor(ever_sex_with_gay_male) + as.factor(condom_use) + as.factor(ever_anal_sex) + as.factor(ever_sex_toys) + as.factor(sexual_orientation) + as.factor(family_cancer) + as.factor(ever_mi) + as.factor(ever_chf) + as.factor(ever_highcholesterol) + as.factor(ever_liverprob), family = binomial)

backwardModel <- step(glm2, direction = "backward")
```
Our second model option is :

```{r}
mod.hiv2 <- glm(hivstat ~ as.factor(ever_highcholesterol) + as.factor(ever_sex_toys) + as.factor(ever_mi) + household_income + as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male) + as.factor(condom_use), family = binomial)
```

We are going to check the goodness of fit with the Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness of fit test. We are going to use this test because we have a large number of covariate patterns (given our large number of covariates)
```{r}
 
hoslem.test(hivstat, fitted(mod.hiv1))
hoslem.test(hivstat, fitted(mod.hiv2))

```
The tests tell us that our models are not very good fits of the data. 

Checking the ROC curves:

```{r}

library(pROC)
predprob <- predict(mod.hiv1,type=c("response"))
roccurve <- roc(hivstat ~ predprob)
plot(roccurve,col="red")
auc(roccurve)

predprob <- predict(mod.hiv2,type=c("response"))
roccurve <- roc(hivstat ~ predprob)
plot(roccurve,col="red")
auc(roccurve)
```
Based on the discrimination test, the area under the first ROC curve (0.6933) is smaller than the area under the second ROC curve (0.7404). This means that the probability that the first model will be able to classify a case correctly is 0.6933, while the probability that the second model will be able to classify a case correctly is 0.7404. This tells us that the second model is better in discriminating between a case (hivstat = 1) and a non-case(hivstat = 0).


Checking for outliers with Cook's Distance:

```{r}
cooksd <- cooks.distance(mod.hiv2)

no_outliers <- subset(all, cooksd <= 4/(nrow(all) - 2))
mod_no_outliers <- glm(hivstat ~ as.factor(ever_highcholesterol) + as.factor(ever_sex_toys) + as.factor(ever_mi) + household_income + as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male) + as.factor(condom_use), data = no_outliers, family = binomial)

extractAIC(mod_no_outliers)
```
The AIC of the model without the outliers is 718.36 which is so much lower than the AIC of the model including the outliers. 



Checking for points with high influence with DFFITS:

```{r}
dffits <- dffits(mod.hiv2)
no_highinfl <- subset(all, dffits <= 2*sqrt((6 + 1)/nrow(all)))
mod_no_highinfl <- glm(hivstat ~ as.factor(ever_highcholesterol) + as.factor(ever_sex_toys) + as.factor(ever_mi) + household_income + as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male) + as.factor(condom_use), data = no_highinfl, family = binomial)

summary(mod_no_highinfl)
```
The p-values of the coefficients become smaller when we remove the points with high influence.

Removing the points with large Cook's Distance AND large DFFITS values : 

```{r}

without_all_outliers <- subset(all, cooksd <= 4/(nrow(all) - 2) &  dffits <= 2*sqrt((6 + 1)/nrow(all)))

mod_wo_all_outliers <- glm(hivstat ~ as.factor(ever_highcholesterol) + as.factor(ever_sex_toys) + as.factor(ever_mi) + household_income + as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male) + as.factor(condom_use), data = without_all_outliers, family = binomial) 

summary(mod_wo_all_outliers)
```
This model gives the smallest AIC so far (672.35), which makes sense because we are removing the outliers and high influence points, without which the model is a better fit. 


Checking for potential effect modifiers:
```{r}

#checking if age is an effect modifier:

temp_model <- mod_wo_all_outliers
#summary(temp_model)

temp_ageinteract <- glm(hivstat ~ as.factor(ever_highcholesterol) + as.factor(ever_sex_toys) + as.factor(ever_mi) + household_income + as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male) + as.factor(condom_use) + age + household_income*age +  as.factor(ever_highcholesterol)*age + as.factor(ever_sex_toys)*age + as.factor(ever_mi)*age +  as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male)*age + as.factor(condom_use)*age, data = without_all_outliers, family = binomial)

summary(temp_ageinteract)

```
age is not an effect modifier of the effect of any of the covariates in the model on HIV status, since the p-values of all the interaction terms are insignificant (> 0.05). 

```{r}
#checking if number of sex partners is an effect modifier

temp_sexpinteract <- glm(hivstat ~ as.factor(ever_highcholesterol) + as.factor(ever_sex_toys) + as.factor(ever_mi) + household_income + as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male) + as.factor(condom_use) + sex_partners+ household_income*sex_partners +  as.factor(ever_highcholesterol)*sex_partners + as.factor(ever_sex_toys)*sex_partners + as.factor(ever_mi)*sex_partners +  as.factor(ever_sex_with_hiv_male)*sex_partners + as.factor(condom_use)*sex_partners, data = without_all_outliers, family = binomial)

summary(temp_sexpinteract)

```
sex_partners is not an effect modifier of the effect of any of the covariates in the model on HIV status, since the p-values of all the interaction terms are insignificant (> 0.05).
